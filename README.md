# ARIANA

## How to install ARIANA

To install ARIANA tools, initially clone the GitHub repository contents into a local folder and copy the contents into ```C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates```. 

Then, quit all Microsoft Office instances and launch Word. A full system reboot could be needed in order to complete the installation, if there are instances of Word running in the background.

## How to configure ARIANA

After copying the files, it might not be possible yet to view the ARIANA-Tools Ribbon menu. If that is the case, perform the following steps:

1. Launch Microsoft Word;
2. Click on "Options" on the bottom-left side of the screen;
![Options menu]()
3. Click on the button "Import/Export" on the bottom-right side of the screen and select "Import customization file"; ![Import customization]()
4. Navigate to the folder "Templates\SetUp" under ARIANA installation folder and select the file "SUP_Q010_ARIANA-Ribbon_v21.exportedUI";
5. The list of ribbon menus to be imported should now have three ARIANA items: ARIANA-Audit, ARIANA-Doc Mgt and ARIANA-Tools
